This is my first project where I explore JavaScript Html and CSS.  I have just started studying code and am using this to gain practical experience.   <br>
// this code is the first code i ever wrote, it was piled on top of itself with no plan or even knowledge of what was possible<br>
// its not very good code but I learned some things<br>
// to do;<br>
// clean this code up<br>
// make it look good<br>
//rewrite functions<br>
<br>  I will continue to develop this project possibly making it a stand alone app in 'Electron' or incorporating a back-end in Python or node.js for users to save their progress.
I plan to add in the campaign next, as present in the board game.
